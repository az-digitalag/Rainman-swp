# Soil water potential at RainManSR
This repository hosts time-series of soil data (VWC and water potential) provided by Joel Biederman and Fangyue Zhang. 

## Data description
There are about 50 VWC sensors and 6 SWP sensors installed. The 6 SWP sensors are matched with 6 SWC sensors in 2 plots and at 3 depths in profile. Tsoil is also provided for screening, correcting, or interpreting diurnal or temperature induced oscillations, which mostly occur in the SWP data at dry values.

Key dates include:
- April/May 2019, plot construction and installation of most VWC sensors
- August 2019, SWP sensors installed
- 10/1/2019, start of data provided
- 10/31/2019, large irrigation applied to prep for transplant
- 11/1/2019, 30 Digitaria californica (Arizona cottontop) transplanted to plot. Plots then receive natural rainfall + irrigation every 1-2 weeks
- May 2020, irrigation ceased and roofs installed
- 7/13/2020, irrigation treatments (temporal repackaging of summer precipitation, S1-S4) applied. Each house contains 3 replicates of each of 4 summer treatments (12 plots per house, 5 houses)
- 10/1/2020, separate winter rainfall treatments ended and all plots have received equal winter treatments, applied every 2 weeks
